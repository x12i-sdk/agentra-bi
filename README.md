# @x12i/agentra-bi usage example

Generic BI layer for product dashboards and reports.

This consuming application demonstrates **compile and run a named business metric over local counters** using the published npm package, pinned to `0.1.0`.

## Run

Requires Node.js 24 or newer and npm. The example needs no service credentials.

```sh
npm install --ignore-scripts
npm start
```

## Example

[`src/index.mjs`](src/index.mjs) contains the complete example. Assertions check the demonstrated behavior and the program prints a small result.

## When to use the package

- Build product dashboard metrics through the generic BI layer.
- Reuse shared report computations across product analytics surfaces.

## Local example data

Events and identities are synthetic. Storage and counters live only in this process. The server example binds an ephemeral loopback port and closes it after the check. Alert actions are empty. No notifications, scheduled jobs, MongoDB writes, or external service calls are performed. Dashboard rendering here produces a data model rather than a browser screen.
